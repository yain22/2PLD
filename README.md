# 2PLD: Optimization of dose selection using multiple surrogates of toxicity as a continuous variable in Phase I cancer trial

For a phase I cancer clinical trial, the number of patients is sharply confined. For this reason, proper exploitation of toxicity information from each of the patients is crucial in designing an adaptive clinical trial. In such a phase I study we have to consider that treatment effect may not be known for months, possibly years, after enrollment: whereas, toxic reactions manifest in terms of days, weeks, or months rather than years. 

Because there is no immediate possibility of assessing the relative advantages of the treatment against its toxic disadvantages, the pharmacological underpinning of a new drug candidate mainly relies on a toxicity-dose curve which describes a relationship between toxicity and dose. The main goal of the phase I studies is to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), or the highest dose at which a pre-specified level of risk of toxicity is not exceeded.
